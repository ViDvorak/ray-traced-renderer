# Raytracing Renderer

The program renderers a scene from XML file, with XML-like syntax. The renderer uses ray tracing techniques to produce images.
Currently supports basic 3D shapes, lights, and materials but is expandable by design to easily add new shapes not just mathematical, but also triangle based.

created by Vít Dvořák for Photorealistic graphics. Later used as credit program for programming in C#.
